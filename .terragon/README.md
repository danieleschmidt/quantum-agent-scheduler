# ü§ñ Terragon Autonomous SDLC System

**Perpetual Value Discovery & Execution for quantum-agent-scheduler**

This directory contains the Terragon Autonomous SDLC enhancement system that continuously discovers, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value development tasks through advanced scoring algorithms and autonomous execution.

## üéØ System Overview

The Terragon system implements a complete autonomous SDLC enhancement loop:

1. **üîç Value Discovery** - Continuously scans for improvement opportunities
2. **üìä Advanced Scoring** - Uses WSJF + ICE + Technical Debt metrics
3. **üöÄ Autonomous Execution** - Automatically implements highest-value items
4. **‚è∞ Intelligent Scheduling** - Runs on optimized schedules for maximum value
5. **üìà Continuous Learning** - Adapts and improves based on outcomes

## üìÅ System Components

### Core Engine Files

- **`value-engine.py`** - Value discovery and prioritization engine
- **`autonomous-executor.py`** - Autonomous task execution system  
- **`scheduler.py`** - Intelligent scheduling and continuous execution
- **`config.yaml`** - System configuration and scoring parameters

### Generated Outputs

- **`backlog.json`** - Machine-readable prioritized backlog
- **`AUTONOMOUS_BACKLOG.md`** - Human-readable backlog report
- **`execution-metrics.json`** - Execution performance metrics
- **`scheduler-metrics.json`** - Scheduling system metrics

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run Value Discovery
```bash
# Discover all value opportunities and generate backlog
python3 .terragon/value-engine.py

# View the generated backlog
cat AUTONOMOUS_BACKLOG.md
```

### Execute Next Best Value Item
```bash  
# Execute the highest-value item autonomously
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py

# Run continuous execution (max 5 items)
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py --continuous 5
```

### Start Autonomous Scheduler
```bash
# Run single cycle based on current needs
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py

# Start continuous daemon (checks every 5 minutes)
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py daemon 5

# Force specific cycle type
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py daily
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py weekly
```

## üìä Value Scoring System

The system uses a composite scoring algorithm combining multiple methodologies:

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
- **User/Business Value** - Impact on users and business outcomes
- **Time Criticality** - Urgency and time-sensitive value
- **Risk Reduction** - Security and technical risk mitigation
- **Opportunity Enablement** - Value of unblocking future work

### ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- **Impact** - Expected business and technical impact (1-10)
- **Confidence** - Certainty in successful execution (0-1)
- **Ease** - Implementation difficulty inverse (1-10)

### Technical Debt Score
- **Debt Impact** - Maintenance burden reduction
- **Debt Interest** - Cost of not addressing the debt
- **Hotspot Multiplier** - Code churn and complexity factors

### Composite Score Formula
```
CompositeScore = (
  0.5 * normalize(WSJF) +
  0.1 * normalize(ICE) + 
  0.3 * normalize(TechnicalDebt) +
  0.1 * SecurityMultiplier
) * PriorityBoost
```

## ‚è∞ Execution Schedules

The autonomous scheduler operates on multiple time horizons:

### Immediate (Post-PR Merge)
- **Trigger**: PR merge detected
- **Focus**: Critical security fixes, build failures
- **Max Items**: 1 critical item

### Hourly
- **Trigger**: Every hour
- **Focus**: Security vulnerabilities, dependency issues
- **Max Items**: 1 security item

### Daily (2 AM UTC)
- **Trigger**: Every 24 hours
- **Focus**: Comprehensive value delivery
- **Max Items**: 3 diverse improvements

### Weekly (Sunday)
- **Trigger**: Every 7 days
- **Focus**: Strategic technical debt reduction
- **Max Items**: 5 substantial improvements

### Monthly (1st of month)
- **Trigger**: Every 30 days
- **Focus**: Modernization and innovation
- **Max Items**: 8 transformative changes

## üîç Discovery Sources

The value discovery engine scans multiple sources:

### Code Analysis
- **Git History** - TODO, FIXME, XXX markers in commits and code
- **Static Analysis** - Ruff, MyPy, Bandit findings
- **Complexity Metrics** - Large files, cyclomatic complexity
- **Dead Code** - Unused imports, unreachable code

### Security & Dependencies  
- **Vulnerability Scans** - Safety, pip-audit, Snyk findings
- **Dependency Audits** - Outdated packages, security advisories
- **Secrets Detection** - Accidentally committed credentials
- **Container Security** - Docker image vulnerabilities

### Performance & Quality
- **Test Coverage** - Missing tests, coverage gaps
- **Performance Profiling** - Slow functions, memory leaks
- **Documentation Gaps** - Missing docstrings, outdated docs
- **Code Quality** - Linting violations, type errors

### Quantum-Specific
- **Circuit Optimization** - Quantum gate count, depth reduction
- **Backend Fallbacks** - Classical fallback implementations
- **Noise Resilience** - Error mitigation strategies
- **Hybrid Optimization** - Classical/quantum resource balance

## üìà Metrics & Learning

### Execution Metrics
- **Tasks Executed** - Total autonomous completions
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful executions  
- **Value Delivered** - Cumulative composite score delivered
- **Cycle Time** - Average execution time per task
- **Category Performance** - Success rates by improvement type

### Learning Adaptations
- **Weight Adjustment** - Scoring weights adapt based on outcomes
- **Effort Calibration** - Estimation accuracy improves over time
- **Risk Assessment** - Confidence models update with results
- **Pattern Recognition** - Similar tasks leverage historical data

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Scoring Weights (config.yaml)
```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    advanced:      # Repository maturity level
      wsjf: 0.5           # WSJF component weight
      ice: 0.1            # ICE component weight  
      technicalDebt: 0.3  # Technical debt weight
      security: 0.1       # Security boost weight
```

### Execution Thresholds
```yaml
scoring:
  thresholds:
    minScore: 15         # Minimum score to execute
    maxRisk: 0.8         # Maximum risk tolerance
    securityBoost: 2.0   # Security multiplier
    complianceBoost: 1.8 # Compliance multiplier
```

### Discovery Sources
```yaml
discovery:
  sources:
    - gitHistory          # Git commit analysis
    - staticAnalysis      # Code quality scanning
    - securityPosture     # Vulnerability detection
    - performanceProfile  # Performance bottlenecks
    - quantumOptimization # Quantum-specific improvements
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Custom Value Categories
Add new value categories by extending the `ValueCategory` enum in `value-engine.py`:

```python
class ValueCategory(Enum):
    SECURITY = "security"
    TECHNICAL_DEBT = "technical_debt"
    PERFORMANCE = "performance"
    # Add your custom category
    CUSTOM_CATEGORY = "custom_category"
```

### Custom Discovery Sources
Implement new discovery methods in the `ValueDiscoveryEngine` class:

```python
def _discover_from_custom_source(self):
    """Custom value discovery logic."""
    # Your discovery implementation
    pass
```

### Custom Execution Handlers
Add execution handlers for new categories in `AutonomousExecutor`:

```python
def _execute_custom_category_item(self, item: ValueItem) -> bool:
    """Execute custom category improvements."""
    # Your execution implementation
    return True
```

## üìä Expected Outcomes

- Follows existing code review and CI/CD processes

### GitHub Actions Integration  
- Deployed workflows provide comprehensive CI/CD automation
- Security scanning and dependency management
- Performance monitoring and regression detection
- Automated releases and documentation updates

### Development Workflow
- Preserves existing development practices
- Enhances rather than replaces manual development
- Provides continuous background improvements
- Surfaces insights through generated reports

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Value discovery finds no items:**
- Check if discovery tools are installed (ruff, mypy, etc.)
- Verify repository has analyzable code content
- Review discovery source configuration

**Execution fails with validation errors:**
- Ensure test suite passes before autonomous execution
- Check that required dependencies are available
- Verify git repository is in clean state

**Scheduling daemon not running:**
- Check process permissions and file access
- Verify configuration file is valid YAML/JSON
- Monitor system resources and log files

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export TERRAGON_DEBUG=1
python3 .terragon/value-engine.py
```

## üìû Support & Contribution

The Terragon Autonomous SDLC system is designed to be self-improving and maintainable. For advanced customizations or integration questions:
