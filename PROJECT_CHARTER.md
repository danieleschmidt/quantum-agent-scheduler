# Project Charter - Quantum Agent Scheduler

## Project Overview

### Project Name
Quantum Agent Scheduler

### Project Purpose
Develop a hybrid classical-quantum computing platform that optimizes multi-agent task scheduling and resource allocation using quantum algorithms, providing unprecedented performance improvements for AI workflow orchestration.

### Business Case
The exponential growth of multi-agent AI systems creates increasingly complex scheduling challenges. Classical optimization algorithms struggle with large-scale problems, while quantum computing offers potential exponential speedups for certain optimization problems. This project bridges that gap by providing the first production-ready quantum-enhanced scheduling platform.
